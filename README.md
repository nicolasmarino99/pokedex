### Objective

The Objective was to the redux and react for filter and transform data from an external Api. In this case I chose a pokemon Api. 

In this app you could find:

- A navbar that automaticly filters a pokemon based on its ID or name.  
- A pokedex with an infinite scroller
- A nice UI design
- Routes to provide extra info

The following features are under construction:

- evolution chains 
- Moves charachteristics
- Testing
- extra filters
