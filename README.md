### Objective

The main goal of this project is to explore and learn the javascript game engine 'phaser', integrating modern technologies (EcmaScript, webpack, npm) for extending the capabilities of the tool (phaser) while testing some code and consuming third party API's.

In this game you could find:

- A fully functional hero with 3 types of attacks, jumps, and slides
- A set of enemies moving and attacking automatically
- A nice level design with tiles, with a paralax background
- A clock and recolected gems for computing scores
- A leaderboard that shows up at the end of each level
- Nice background music
- Nice User experience 
- Nice set of animations

The following features are under construction:

- Health and item's manager 
- Combat system between characters
- Enemies AI
- Enemies health
- async testing

### Learning process

I decided to integrate a gitBook documentation with this repository for showing step by step how I made this project. The book is still in progress though.
